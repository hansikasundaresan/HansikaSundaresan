Hi! I’m Hansika and I’m an aspiring computer scientist studying at the [University of Texas Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/). I am pursuing a specialization in data science and artificial intelligence. I am growing my knowledge and experience in the industry to empower other women to pursue a career in technology. 

I am a member of UTD’s [Computing Scholars Program](http://cs.utdallas.edu/computingscholars/) and [Collegium V Honors College](https://honors.utdallas.edu/cv). In my free time, I enjoy performing [South Indian Classical Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbCD_Oak6o), volunteering with Non-profit organizations, and getting involved on Campus. 


**Updates**

- Summer 2020: I am interning at Wells Fargo apart of their Technology Program
- Sumer 2020: I co-founded the [Ladies in Tech Mentoring Program](https://hansikasundaresan.github.io/LadiesInTech/) at UTD
- April 2020: I earned leadership positions in Women who Compute, WEHack, and Society of Women Engineers Conference Committee
