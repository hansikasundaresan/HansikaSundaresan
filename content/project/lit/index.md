_Website created to serve as a marketing strategy as well as an informative website. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/hansikasundaresan/LadiesinTech). Final website can be found [here](https://hansikasundaresan.github.io/LadiesInTech/)_

### Creating the Website
As a co-founder and co-director of the Ladies in Tech Mentoring Program at UTD, I spearheaded marketing strategies to increase membership in the program. I went through numerous Udemy courses to learn relevent skills to web development.
