### Creating the Coloring Book

Along with two others, I created a coloring book with various pictures in it. As this was my first extra ciricular project, I spent a large amount of time improving the code, style, and user-interface.

Working on both the back-end and front-end development, I created various options for colors, images, and sub-compnenets of the images for the user to experiment.
While working on the project, I utilzied unit testing to ensure that the interface was working well and did numerous test runs with classmates. 
I made sure the methods were efficient, concise, and clear in its purpose. This was definitely one of the most fun projects I have worked on. 

The best part of the whole project was during the demo for classmates. While some classmates were coloring pictures, my teacher walked over and asked us to stop playing games. Then my teammates and I explained to her how the game was our project.
It was a gratifying expereince and a large reason for my inclination to pursue computer science as my higher studies. 

The project allowed the user to chose from 3 pictures to color:
