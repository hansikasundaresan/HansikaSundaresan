### Creating the AI assistant

My interest in Artificial intelligence started with 'Hey Siri' and 'Hey Google'. Once I knew I would pursue computer science, data science and artificial intelligence were fields I knew I was interested. While my school does not have courses centralized on python, I decided to take some online courses to expose myself to the relevent coding language. When I was browsing youtube on AI, I came accross someone making an AI assistant and knew I wanted to try. [This](https://github.com/hansikasundaresan/AI-Assistant) is the result of my interests. If you would like to try it out on your own device, please make sure to read the [ReadMe](https://github.com/hansikasundaresan/AI-Assistant/blob/master/README.md).
